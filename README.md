# Welcome to the RentGraph project! #

This project has been built for users to purchase graphics related services such as Twitch emotes, characatuers and blueprints. When logged in, users can add posts and edit the posts on the site. Users can also leave user feedback which will help improve the site in the longrun.

## UX #

This project has a mobile first approach. The website provides a clear and approachable format for all users, regardless of device or resolution. The user will also be able to navigate around the site using the nav bar, this will show as top bar in desktop, and as a burger menu in mobile.

### User Stories #

* As a user I want to be able to pruchase the posts shown on the site.
* As a user I want to be able to leave feedback on the site.
* As a user I want to be able to login to edit and add posts.
* As a user I want to know what I am buying in a checkout screen.

### Features #

Here you can find a list of available features from the RentGraph website.

* Purchase any of the advertised posts
* Create or edit posts whilst logged in

### Further Functionality #

Further functionality I would like to add in the future includes but is not limited to:

* Search for posts
* Filter posts based on tag
* Have posts be tied to user's accounts
* Add ability to link up paypal so artists receive their revenue automatically
* Have feedback be stored in a table to read at a later date
